# Georgia Blake (Textile Designer) Portfolio/CV Website

This site is a portfolio/CV site for a textile designer called Georgia Blake. Its primary function is to introduce Georgia to pottential recruiters or other textile designers, to give them an accurate idea of her style and competancies, without confusing of frustrating them. The project is designed to be useful both to recruiters and other members of the textile community. This means that it has to function well as a showcase Georgia's work while containing smooth and frictionless pathways to getting in contact with Georgia herself (for either collaborators or recruiters.) Given the variety of pottential users, it is of paramount importance that the user experience be consistently good across all commonly used devices.

As the project is for an artist, it would be beneficial for it to reflect something of that artist's personality. This is why the project has minimalist look that incorporates color and font choices inspired by Georgia's logo. Indeed, the design and feel of the site is intended to flow from the design and feel of the logo. It is also deliberately sparse. After all, this is a portfolio site, it is intended to be (among other things) a vessel for the work of the artist. One wouldn't want the design of the site to distract from that work, hence a minimal and stylistically cosistent approach has been applied throughout.
 
## UX

As mentioned in the introduction, there are two main catergories of target user for this project: recruiters and other textile designers. While their needs are similar they are not the same. To give you some idea of how their needs may differ and why my project is the best way for them to fulfill their needs, I will outline four user stories below. Two, for two seperate types of recruiter, two for two seprerate types of textile designer. 

### Recruiter 1 (Looking for a costume designer for a film, doesn't know anything about Georgia Blake yet)

This recruiter (lets call her Rebbecca) is searching for a costume designer for an upcoming major film, being shot near London. She needs someone good, whose body of work indicates a compatibility with the project, and she needs them fast. Somehow, she's come to Georgia's portfolio page, perhaps through a collegues, on Linkedin, or perhaps Georgia has emailed it to her. The things she needs to see are: 1. examples of Georgia's work, 2. Georgia's work history, and 3. Her contact information, provided Rebbecca is happy with what she sees in 1 and 2. 

When she lands on the homepage she will immediatley see the eye catching logo with 'Blake designs' and know she's in the right place. Beneath that she will see the nav bar, which has 'home, portfolio, CV, and contact'  written clearly and boldly in several large buttons. She may, at this point, immediatley navigate straight to portfolio and inspect her work. Then she may continue on to CV and inspect that also, this will be easy as the nav bar remains the same across the site's pages, whatever the device Rebbecca is using. If she needs to download a copy of the CV, this will be easy for her to do, as a large eye catching button is there on the 'cv' page for her to do it with. It is near the top of the page, meaning if she already knows that she needs a document version of the CV, she can just download it straight away without having to search.  If she want's to get in contact with Georgia, she easily can, by either using the information in the downloaded CV, by clicking the contact button in the nav bar, or by using the information she may have already read from the homepage.

### Recruiter 2 (Already familiar with Georgia just wants to contact her)

Maybe this recruiter is Rebbecca but later on, after having thought about Georgia's CV. She's decided to contact Georgia now, so just needs the information to do it. So she google's Georgia's name, navigates to her portfolio site and quickly find the information she needs as it is right there on the homepage. If somehow she doesn't scroll to it (maybe on mobile where it is at the bottom of the page) then she is likely to see the contact link in the nav bar, which will allow her to complete her goal none the less. 

### Textile designer 1 (Doesn't know Georgia, has found her site on a costume designer forum.)
 
This type of user (let's call them Greg) isn't interested in hiring Georgia and so will have little interest in her work history. Greg just want's to see what Georgia is about, so will probably spend more time on the homepage then might quickly navigate to the portfolio to look at her work. Should he see something of interest that inspires him to contact her about a pottential conllaboration, then he can easily do so from the 'Contact' page found in the nav bar. 
<!---Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. --->

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
